# Living Docs - A Blog Series

Welcome to the repository for the "Living Docs" blog series! This series explores the intersection of technical writing, AI-powered assistance, and documentation best practices through an ongoing narrative.

Follow the journey of our characters as they navigate the challenges of creating and maintaining effective documentation in a world increasingly influenced by Large Language Models (LLMs).

## üìñ The Story So Far

The blog posts are structured as chapters in an unfolding story:

*   **Chapter 1: Writing Style Guide** ([bg_living-doc_ch1-writing-style.md](bg_living-doc_ch1-writing-style.md)) - Introduces the concept of AI learning from existing documentation.
*   **Chapter 2: The Scribe Protocol** ([bg_living-doc_ch2-co-writing-tips.md](bg_living-doc_ch2-co-writing-tips.md)) - Explores co-writing with an AI and teaching it tone.
*   **Chapter 3: The Sycophant‚Äôs Lie** ([bg_living-doc_ch3-sycophant-lie.md](bg_living-doc_ch3-sycophant-lie.md)) - Highlights the dangers of blindly trusting AI-generated content.
*   **Chapter 4: The Training Grimoire** ([bg_living-doc_ch4-training-grimoire.md](bg_living-doc_ch4-training-grimoire.md)) - Delves into prompt engineering and versioning.
*   **Chapter 5: The Drift Detective** ([bg_living-doc_ch5-drifting-detective.md](bg_living-doc_ch5-drifting-detective.md)) - Introduces AI personas for auditing and drift detection.
*   **Chapter 6: The Shadow Library** ([bg_living-doc_ch6-shadow-library.md](bg_living-doc_ch6-shadow-library.md)) - Uncovers the value and risks of informal, "shadow" documentation.

And it all started with a [01-hello-world.md](01-hello-world.md).
